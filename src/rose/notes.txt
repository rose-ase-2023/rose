Possible Problems:

1)  Seede doesn't like classes defined inside methods.

2)  Location error caused by recursive calls don't work -- need to handle calling locations.
        This is unlike case where we are looking for variables and none are affected by the
        call.

3)  Return value need doesn't propogate to return? (Levenshtein)

4)  Need ability to specify test case (main) shouldn't be changed
